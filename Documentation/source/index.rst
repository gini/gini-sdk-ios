Gini SDK Documentation
======================

Introduction
------------

Gini provides an information extraction system for analyzing documents (e. g. invoices or
contracts), specifically information such as the document sender or the amount to pay in an invoice.

The Gini SDK library encapsulates the Gini API and makes the integration into your app a
breeze.
